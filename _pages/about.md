I am an Assistant Professor of Political Economy and Cyber Policy at the University of Texas at Dallas. My research studies questions of politics using text analysis, machine learning, and causal inference. My recent projects focus on mass protest, cybersecurity, and political control in autocracies. More broadly, I study how digital technology shapes political behavior. 

My work has been published in [_American Political Science Review_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055420000295), [_World Politics_](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887114000215), [_European Journal of Political Economy_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.08.003), [_Post-Soviet Affairs_](https://doi.org/10.1080/1060586X.2013.859434), [_Europe-Asia Studies_](https://doi.org/10.1080/09668136.2013.838055), and [_Problems of Post-Communism_](https://doi.org/10.2753/PPC1075-8216600203). I published in American and Russian printed and electronic media, including [_The Monkey Cage Blog_](https://themonkeycage.org/2012/03/the-complicated-views-of-pro-and-anti-putin-protestors/), the leading Russian business daily [_Vedomosti_](https://www.vedomosti.ru/authors/anton-sobolev/documents), and [_Forbes-Russia_](http://www.forbes.ru/mneniya-column/siloviki/249581-nauchilsya-li-rossiiskii-biznes-zashchishchatsya-ot-silovikov).

Prior to my appointment at Yale, I received my Ph.D. in Political Science and M.Sc. in Statistics from University of California, Los Angeles. Before coming to UCLA, I was a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Institutions and Development at Higher School of Economics in Moscow (2013-14).

Since the results of R&D investments typically emerge years after the elected incumbent leaves her office, why do incumbent politicians pursue such policies? 



My [dissertation](dissertation/) explores the information tools employed by modern non-democratic leaders to maintain political control and their citizens’ probable responses to the strategies these tools make possible. It focuses primarily on government hiring of agents to impersonate ordinary citizens and engage online and offline with members of the political opposition. 

My other current projects cover a wide range of questions associated with collective behavior in the broadest sense. In collaboration with [Keith Chen (UCLA and Uber)](http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/), [Zachary Steinert-Threlkeld (UCLA)](https://zacharyst.com/), and [Jungseock Joo (UCLA)](http://home.jsjoo.com/), I am developing a set of spatial deep learning models to examine the diffusion of protest in the United States after the presidential election of 2016. In a separate paper, we detail our study of the accuracy of estimates of crowd sizes generated by social media data. 

In another project co-authored with [Dmitry Dagaev (Moscow, HSE)](https://www.hse.ru/en/staff/ddagaev), [Natalia Lamberova (UCLA)](https://sites.google.com/site/natalialamberova/) and [Konstantin Sonin (Univeristy of Chicago)](https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/konstantin-sonin), I study how communication technology has changed the architecture of social movements worldwide [(check our recent paper)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2019.08.003).

I have conducted field research in Russia, funded by Carnegie Corporation of New York, Emory University, Moscow Higher School of Economics, Indiana University, and St Petersburg University.
Before starting my PhD program at UCLA, I was a research fellow at the Center for the Study of Institutions and Development (2013-14) and a lecturer at the Department of Political Science at Higher School of Economics in Moscow (2010-13). I received *“The Best Lecturer of the Political Science Department”* Award in 2012. I also was a visiting research fellow at Russian & East European Institute at Indiana University.
