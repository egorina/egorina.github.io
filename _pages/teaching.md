## CURRENT TEACHING 

**UT Dallas**, ***School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences*** (Fall 2022) 

  * *PPPE  / PSCI 6302* Political Violence and Conflict in Cyberspace  [Class Website](https://elearning.utdallas.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_4287675_1&course_id=_210379_1)

In this discussion-based and interdisciplinary seminar, we examine concepts, causes, and consequences of different types of political violence and war, with a special focus on how cyber attacks compare causally and strategically to more conventional types of conflicts. Finally, we will discuss the different policy responses to cyber versus conventional attacks.

Students get free access to DataCamp to prepare themselves for the coding part of this course. [Link to DataCamp for UTD students](#PendingDatacampApproval)

The course is divided into four parts. The first introduces the basic concepts and definitions related to policy, governance, and threats. The second part exposes students to the modern policy analysis toolkit.

  * *PLSC-455* Big Data, AI, and Russian Politics [Class Website](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/60670)

This cross-disciplinary seminar focuses on two broad questions. First: how do politicians use new technologies to influence politics? Second: how do scholars use new technologies to study politics? It uses Russia as a laboratory to explore these questions. The course consists of four parts. It starts with a review of contemporary Russia and pays attention to the quantitative studies of its economy and politics. Next, the course provides a non-technical introduction to Big Data and AI algorithms. Finally, it outlines the applications of the new technologies to the study of Russian politics.
