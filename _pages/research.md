## CURRENT WORKS

[**“Effects of a Defined Contribution Retirement Plan on Teacher Attrition in Alaska,”**](https://appam.confex.com/appam/2020/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/38090) (with Jen Sidorova, Anil Niraula, and Marc Joffe) [*Link*](https://appam.confex.com/appam/2020/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/38090)

In 2006, Alaska enacted a radical retirement system reform by discontinuing its defined-benefit (DB) pension plan and creating a 401(k)-style defined contribution (DC) plan for all new hires. The reform produced a change in accrual patterns, mandated a fixed contribution rate for the employer, increased retirement benefit portability, and transferred the investment risk to the employee. Using individual-level data for all Alaska teachers in the Teacher Retirement System from 2005 to 2017, we assess how this reform affected teacher mobility out of K-12 employment and the resulting composition of the teacher workforce. We observe few changes in teacher characteristics while documenting higher odds of separation among teachers in the DC plan relative to their DB counterparts.

## PREVIOUSLY

[**“Pension Reforms and Public Sector Turnover”**](https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muz009)

Over the past decade, many states have reformed their retirement systems by reducing benefit generosity, tightening retirement provisions, introducing non-defined-benefit (DB) plan options and even replacing DB plans with defined-contribution plans. Many of these reforms have affected post-employment benefits that public workers will receive when they retire. Have these reforms also affected the attractiveness of public sector employment? To answer this question, we use state-level data from 2002 to 2015 and examine the relationship between state pension reforms and public employee turnover following the reforms. We find that employee responsiveness to the reforms was tangible and that it differed by reform type and worker education. These results are important because the design of public retirement benefits will continue to influence the ability of the public sector to recruit and retain high-quality workforce.
